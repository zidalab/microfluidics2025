# Microfluidics Course Website

Welcome to the official website for the Microfluidics course. This repository hosts all the source code and content for the course website.

## Course Description

This course provides a systematic introduction to the fundamental theories, core technologies, and cutting-edge applications of microfluidics. As an interdisciplinary field, microfluidics studies the behavior and application of fluids at the micrometer scale, involving physics, chemistry, engineering, materials science, and biology. The curriculum will cover the fabrication of microfluidic chips, fluid control methods, droplet microfluidics, and will focus on its applications in biomedical testing, molecular diagnostics, and single-cell analysis.
