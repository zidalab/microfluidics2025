# Final Paper Assignment  

At the end of the course, you are required to select a topic related to **microfluidics and its biomedical applications**, conduct a focused literature survey, and submit a written final paper.  

The purpose of this assignment is to:  
- Explore one area of microfluidics in greater depth.  
- Practice reviewing scientific literature.  
- Develop your ability to communicate technical concepts clearly.  

---

## Expectations  

- Choose one topic from the provided list (or propose an alternative topic with approval).  
- Conduct a literature survey using peer-reviewed journals, review articles, and other credible sources.  
- Summarize the current state of research in your chosen area, highlighting key methods, findings, and open challenges.  
- Organize your report clearly with an introduction, main sections, and a conclusion.  
- Provide proper references in a consistent citation format.  

---

## Paper Guidelines  

- **Length:** Approximately 5â€“7 pages (excluding references).  
- **Format:** Double-spaced, 12-point font, standard margins.  
- **Figures/Diagrams:** Encouraged where helpful.  
- **Due date:** *November 15th (tentative).*
